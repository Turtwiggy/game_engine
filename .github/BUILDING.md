    ./thirdparty/vcpkg/vcpkg install @deps_vcpkg_x64-linux.txt
    ./thirdparty/vcpkg/vcpkg --overlay-ports=./thirdparty/GameNetworkingSockets/vcpkg_ports/ install gamenetworkingsockets:x64-linux

### Building (CMake)

I develop with visual studio code. You can open the .code-workspace using the C/C++ extention tools:
